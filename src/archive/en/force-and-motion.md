### <strong>Forces and motion</strong>

Forces and motion, inspired by *Newton's* discoveries, are fundamental to **physics**.

> Forces influence nearly every branch, and with force comes motion.

*Forces* can involve: 
- Direct contact (like pushing or pulling);
- Act at a distance (gravity, magnetism or atomic forces)
<br/>

**Second law of Newton:**

$$ F = m \\cdot a $$

To catch an egg without breaking it, you need to reduce its **deceleration**, as Newton's second law shows that less acceleration means less force on the egg. \$ m \$ is mass and \$ a \$ is acceleration
