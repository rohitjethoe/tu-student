### <strong>Forces and motion</strong>

Forces and motion, inspired by *Newton's* discoveries, are fundamental to **physics**.

> Forces influence nearly every branch, and with force comes motion.

*Forces* can involve: 
- Direct contact (like pushing or pulling);
- Act at a distance (gravity, magnetism or atomic forces)
<br/>

**Second law of Newton:**

$$ F = m \\cdot a $$

To catch an egg without breaking it, you need to reduce its **deceleration**, as Newton's second law shows that less acceleration means less force on the egg. \$ m \$ is mass and \$ a \$ is acceleration


Mechanics studies how forces cause motion. Newton's laws form the foundation:

    First Law: Without force, velocity remains constant.
    Second Law: Force equals mass times acceleration (F=maF=ma), meaning larger forces cause greater changes in velocity.
    Third Law: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

Motion involves position and velocity, where velocity is the rate of change of position, and acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Integrating acceleration gives velocity, and integrating velocity gives position.

Key examples include:

    A ball tossed up and affected by gravity accelerates downward (a=9.8â€‰m/s2a=9.8m/s2), following a parabolic path.
    Projectile motion, like cannonballs, combines horizontal motion (constant velocity) and vertical motion (affected by gravity), creating a parabola. The trajectory depends on speed and launch angle.

Next, the study moves to systems with multiple forces.
