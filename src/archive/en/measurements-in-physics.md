###### **Quantities and Units**
**Physical quantities** are those things that are *measurable*:
- Such as mass, length, time, electrical current.
- Quantities are related to <span class="gray">equations</span>
- Such as the density equation $ \\rho = \\dfrac{m}{V} $

<br />

Symbols represent quantities — Symbols in the equations are all written in *italic* fonts 

Units are always written in Roman font:
- Quantities sometimes share symbols:
    <ul class="circle">
        <li>"$m$" represents "mass"</li>
        <li>m represents "metre"</li>
    </ul>

<br />

**Fundamental quantities** = those quantities that are so basic  that <span class="gray">all other quantites are expressed in terms of them</span>.

In the density equation $ \\rho = \\dfrac{m}{V} $ only mass is <span class="gray">fundamental</span>.

<span class="gray">Density</span> and <span class="gray">volume</span> are **derived quantities**

<br />

> "It is essential that all measurements made by one person are understood by others"

We use units that have <span class="gray">unambigious</span> meaning:
- The world wide standard for units is known as <br /> <span class="gray">*SI — Systéme international d' unités*</span>.

- When values of scientific quantitities are communicated, there should never be any confusion.

The SI defines both units and prefixes — letters used to form decimal multiples or sub-multiples of the units (kg; g, km; m).

<br />

The <span class="gray">units themselves are classified as</span> being either:
- fundamental (or *base*)
- derived
- supplementary

There are <span class="gray">two supplementary units in SI</span>:
- *the radian (rad)* — the unit of angle measurements
    <ul class="circle">
        <li>useful alternative to the degree,</li>
        <li>defined as <u>the angle subtended by an arc of a circle having the same length as the radius</u>.</li>
    </ul>
- *the steradian (sr)* — the unit of solid angle
    <ul>
        <li>three-dimensional equivalent of the radion,</li>
        <li>uses the idea of mapping a circle on the surface of a sphere.</li>
    </ul>

###### **Fundamental and derived units**

SI uses <span class="gray">seven</span> **fundamental units** and we use <span class="gray">six</span>.

- length
- mass
- time
- electric current
- thermodynamic temperature
- amount of substance
- luminous intensity

These quantities have <span class="gray">exact definitions and are precisely reproducible</span>

1. **<u>metre (m)</u>**
2. **<u>kilogram (kg)</u>**
3. **<u>seconds (s)</u>**
4. **<u>ampere (A)</u>**
5. **<u>kelvin (K)</u>**
6. **<u>mole (mol)</u>**
7. **<u>candle (cd)</u>** (not included in Diploma Programme)

Quantities that are not fundament are known as <span class="gray">*derived quantities*</span>

Derived quantities can be expressed through relevant questions; for example, <span class="gray">speed is the rate of change of distance with respect to time</span> or in equation form:

$$ \\nu = \\dfrac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t} $$

where $ \\Delta s $ means change in distance and $ \\Delta t $ means change in time. <span class="gray">Both distance (length) and time are fundamental quantities, speed is a derived quantity.</span>

<u>Fundamental quantitites</u> have their own basic units (e.g., meter, kilogram, second). 

<u>Derived quantities</u> have units that are combinations of these fundamental units. 

For instance <span class="gray">the pascal (Pa) unit</span>: $ m^{-1} \\cdot kg \\cdot s^{-2} $

<br /> 

**Example of how we relate fundamental and derived units, like with newton (N)**

1. The unit of force is the newton (N) <span class="gray">this is a derived unit</span> and can be expressed in terms of fundamental units as kgms<sup>-2</sup>. 

2. This is <span class="gray">because force is defined as the product of *mass* and *acceleration*</span> or $ F = ma $.

3. <span class="gray">*Mass* is a fundamental quantity but *acceleration* is not</span>. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity or: 

$$ a = \\dfrac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t} $$

<span class="list">Where $ \\Delta v $ represents <span class="gray">change in velocity</span> and $ \\Delta t $ again being <span class="gray">change in time</span>.</span>

<br />

4. *Time* is a fundamental quantity but *velocity* is not. Velocity is <span class="gray">the rate of change of displacement</span> or
$$ v = \\dfrac{\\Delta s }{\\Delta t} $$

<span class="list">
With $ \\Delta s $ being change in displacement and $ \\Delta t $ being the change in time, which are both fundamental units.
</span>

<br />
<br />

5. The unit of velocity is $ m \\cdot s^{-1} $. The units of acceleration will therefore be $ \\dfrac{m \\cdot s^{-1}}{s} $ which is written as $ m \\cdot s^{-2} $.

This unit is named newton (N), since it's so common.

$$ N \\equiv kgms^{-2} $$
