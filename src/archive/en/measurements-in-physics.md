###### **Quantities and Units**
**Physical quantities** are those things that are *measurable*:
- Such as mass, length, time, electrical current.
- Quantities are related to <span class="gray">equations</span>
- Such as the density equation $ \\rho = \\dfrac{m}{V} $

<br />

Symbols represent quantities — Symbols in the equations are all written in *italic* fonts 

Units are always written in Roman font:
- Quantities sometimes share symbols:
    <ul class="circle">
        <li>"$m$" represents "mass"</li>
        <li>m represents "metre"</li>
    </ul>

<br />

**Fundamental quantities** = those quantities that are so basic  that <span class="gray">all other quantites are expressed in terms of them</span>.

In the density equation $ \\rho = \\dfrac{m}{V} $ only mass is <span class="gray">fundamental</span>.

<span class="gray">Density</span> and <span class="gray">volume</span> are **derived quantities**

<br />

> "It is essential that all measurements made by one person are understood by others"

We use units that have <span class="gray">unambigious</span> meaning:
- The world wide standard for units is known as <br /> <span class="gray">*SI — Systéme international d' unités*</span>.

- When values of scientific quantitities are communicated, there should never be any confusion.

The SI defines both units and prefixes — letters used to form decimal multiples or sub-multiples of the units (kg; g, km; m).

<br />

The <span class="gray">units themselves are classified as</span> being either:
- fundamental (or *base*)
- derived
- supplementary

There are <span class="gray">two supplementary units in SI</span>:
- *the radian (rad)* — the unit of angle measurements
    <ul class="circle">
        <li>useful alternative to the degree,</li>
        <li>defined as <u>the angle subtended by an arc of a circle having the same length as the radius</u>.</li>
    </ul>
- *the steradian (sr)* — the unit of solid angle
    <ul>
        <li>three-dimensional equivalent of the radion,</li>
        <li>uses the idea of mapping a circle on the surface of a sphere.</li>
    </ul>

<br />

###### **Fundamental and derived units**

SI uses <span class="gray">seven</span> **fundamental units** and we use <span class="gray">six</span>.

- length
- mass
- time
- electric current
- thermodynamic temperature
- amount of substance
- luminous intensity

These quantities have <span class="gray">exact definitions and are precisely reproducible</span>

1. **<u>metre (m)</u>**
2. **<u>kilogram (kg)</u>**
3. **<u>seconds (s)</u>**
4. **<u>ampere (A)</u>**
5. **<u>kelvin (K)</u>**
6. **<u>mole (mol)</u>**
7. **<u>candle (cd)</u>** (not included in Diploma Programme)

Quantities that are not fundament are known as <span class="gray">*derived quantities*</span>

Derived quantities can be expressed through relevant questions; for example, <span class="gray">speed is the rate of change of distance with respect to time</span> or in equation form:

$$ \\nu = \\dfrac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t} $$

where $ \\Delta s $ means change in distance and $ \\Delta t $ means change in time. <span class="gray">Both distance (length) and time are fundamental quantities, speed is a derived quantity.</span>

<u>Fundamental quantitites</u> have their own basic units (e.g., meter, kilogram, second). 

<u>Derived quantities</u> have units that are combinations of these fundamental units. 

For instance <span class="gray">the pascal (Pa) unit</span>: $ m^{-1} \\cdot kg \\cdot s^{-2} $

<br /> 

**Example of how we relate fundamental and derived units, like with newton (N)**

1. The unit of force is the newton (N) <span class="gray">this is a derived unit</span> and can be expressed in terms of fundamental units as kgms<sup>-2</sup>. 

2. This is <span class="gray">because force is defined as the product of *mass* and *acceleration*</span> or $ F = ma $.

3. <span class="gray">*Mass* is a fundamental quantity but *acceleration* is not</span>. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity or: 

$$ a = \\dfrac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t} $$

<span class="list">Where $ \\Delta v $ represents <span class="gray">change in velocity</span> and $ \\Delta t $ again being <span class="gray">change in time</span>.</span>

<br />

4. *Time* is a fundamental quantity but *velocity* is not. Velocity is <span class="gray">the rate of change of displacement</span> or
$$ v = \\dfrac{\\Delta s }{\\Delta t} $$

<span class="list">
With $ \\Delta s $ being change in displacement and $ \\Delta t $ being the change in time, which are both fundamental units.
</span>

<br />
<br />

5. The unit of velocity is $ m \\cdot s^{-1} $. The <span class="gray">units of acceleration</span> will therefore be $ \\dfrac{m \\cdot s^{-1}}{s} $ which is written as $ m \\cdot s^{-2} $.

This unit is named <span class="gray">newton</span> ($N$), since it's so common.

$$ N \\equiv kgms^{-2} $$

<br />

###### **Significant figures**

How many digits do we write down in answers?

Scientists use a method of to a certain number of significant figures (abbreviated to s.f.) <span class="gray">"Significant" means meaningful</span>.

<span class="gray">Some rules for using significant figures</span>:
- Non-zero digits are always significant — 345 (3 s.f.)
- Zeros that occur <span class="gray">sandwiched</span> between non-zero digits are **always significant** — 3405 (4 s.f.); 10.3405 (6 s.f.)
- Zeros that occur to the right of the decimal point **are significant** — 1.034 (4 s.f.); 1.00 (3 s.f.); 0.34500 (5 s.f.); 0.003 (1 s.f.)

- Non-sandwiched zeroes occuring to the left of a non-zero digit are **not significant** — 0.345 (3 s.f.); 0.034 (2 s.f.)

- When there is no decimal point, trailing zeros are **not significant** (to make them significant there NEEDS to be a decimal point) — 400 (1 s.f.); 400. (3 s.f.) — **this is rarely written**.

<br />

###### **Scientific notation**
Physicists deal with the very large (e.g. the universe) and the very small (e.g. electrons) — Many physical constant are also very large or very small. We can <span class="gray">avoid writing many digits</span> by using **scientific notation**.

The speed of *light* has a value of 299 792 458 m s <sup>-1</sup>. This can be rounded to <span class="gray">three significant figures</span> as 300 000 000 m s <sup>-1</sup> 

**In scientific notation** this number is written as 3.00 × 10<sup>8</sup> m s 
- Mass of the *Sun* could be written as 1.989 × 10<sup>30</sup> kg

**Small numbers** like the *electron* **use similar ideas**. 
- An electron approximately 0.000 000 000 000 000 000 1602 coulombs. We write our coefficient as 1.602
- The base is always 10 and moving our decimal point to the right means the exponent is negative.
- So an electron is approximately 1.602 × 10<sup>-19</sup> C.

Some rules for scientific notation:
- When **adding** or **subtracting** numbers, the exponent must be the same 
- When **multiplying** numbers we add the exponents
- When **dividing** numbers we subtract one exponent from the other
- When **raising** numbers we raise the coefficient to the power and multiply the exponent by the power.
