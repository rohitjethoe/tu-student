**Physical quantities** are those things that are *measurable*:
- Such as mass, length, time, electrical current.
- Quantities are related to <span class="gray">equations</span>
- Such as the density equation $ \\rho = \\dfrac{m}{V} $

<br />

Symbols represent quantities — Symbols in the equations are all written in *italic* fonts 

Units are always written in Roman font:
- Quantities sometimes share symbols:
    <ul class="circle">
        <li>"$m$" represents "mass"</li>
        <li>m represents "metre"</li>
    </ul>

<br />

**Fundamental quantities** = those quantities that are so basic  that <span class="gray">all other quantites are expressed in terms of them</span>.

In the density equation $ \\rho = \\dfrac{m}{V} $ only mass is <span class="gray">fundamental</span>.

<span class="gray">Density</span> and <span class="gray">volume</span> are **derived quantities**

<br />

> "It is essential that all measurements made by one person are understood by others"

We use units that have <span class="gray">unambigious</span> meaning:
- The world wide standard for units is known as <br /> <span class="gray">*SI — Systéme international d' unités*</span>.

- When values of scientific quantitities are communicated, there should never be any confusion.

The SI defines both units and prefixes — letters used to form decimal multiples or sub-multiples of the units (kg; g, km; m).

The <span class="gray">units themselves are classified as</span> being either:
- fundamental (or *base*)
- derived
- supplementary
