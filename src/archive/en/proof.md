###### **What is proof?**

> A **proof** in mathematics often consists of a logical set of steps that validats the truth of a general statement beyond any doubt.

There are many ways of presenting a proof.

A **direct proof** is a way of <span class="gray">showing the truth of a given statement by contstructing a series of reasoned connected established facts</span>. In a direct proof the following steps are used:
- Identify the given statement.
- Use axioms, theorems, etc, to make deductions that prove the conclusion of your statement to be true

A **direct proof** = showing the truth by constructing a series of reasoned connected established facts. 

In a <span class="gray">direct proof</span> the following steps are used:
- Identify the given statement.
- Use axioms, theorems, etc to make deductions to prove the conclusion of the statement is true

**Contrapositive** = assume the second part of a statement is false and show that this leads to a contradiction, <span class="gray">i.e. the first part of the statement was also false</span>.

**Proof by contradiction** = if a proposition is true then its contrapositive is also true. If statement $a$ implies $b$ then it is also true if $b$ is false, this implies that $a$ is false.

When setting out a <span class="gray">proof by contradiction</span>:
- Identify what is implied by the statement
- Assume the implication is false
- Use axioms, theorems, etc to arrive at a contradiction
- This proves that the original statement must be true
