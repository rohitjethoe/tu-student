###### **Sequences**

A **sequence** = list written in a defined order
- Each number making up a sequence is called a **term**
- Sequence is also called a **progression**

Sequences may be **finite** or **infinite**
- $7,5,3,1,-1,-3$ is a <span class="gray">finite</span> sequence
- $7,5,3,1,-1,-3,...$ is a <span class="gray">infinite</span> sequence

<br /> 
<br />

A sequence can also be written in terms of **the general term** $\\{u_r\\}$
- $\\{u_r\\}=\\{3r - 1\\}$, where $r \\in \\Z^{+}$ represents the infinite sequence $2,5,8,11,...$
- $\\{u_r\\}=\\{\\dfrac{1}{r^2}\\}$, where $r \\in \\Z^{+}, r \\leq 5$ represents the finite sequence  $1,\\dfrac{1}{4},\\dfrac{1}{9},\\dfrac{1}{16},\\dfrac{1}{25}$
