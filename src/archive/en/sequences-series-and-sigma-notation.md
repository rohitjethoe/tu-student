###### **Sequences**

A **sequence** = list written in a defined order
- Each number making up a sequence is called a **term**
- Sequence is also called a **progression**

Sequences may be **finite** or **infinite**
- $7,5,3,1,-1,-3$ is a <span class="gray">finite</span> sequence
- $7,5,3,1,-1,-3,...$ is a <span class="gray">infinite</span> sequence

<br /> 
<br />

A sequence can also be written in terms of **the general term** $\\{u_r\\}$
- $u_r$ without brackets represents the $r$th term.
- $\\{u_r\\}=\\{3r - 1\\}$, where $r \\in \\Z^{+}$ represents the infinite sequence $2,5,8,11,...$
- $\\{u_r\\}=\\{\\dfrac{1}{r^2}\\}$, where $r \\in \\Z^{+}, r \\leq 5$ represents the finite sequence  $1,\\dfrac{1}{4},\\dfrac{1}{9},\\dfrac{1}{16},\\dfrac{1}{25}$

<br /> 
<br />

###### **Series**

A **series** = all terms in a sequence added together, can also either be <span class="gray">finite</span> or <span class="gray">infinite</span>

The **set of positive integers** $\\Z^+$ can be written as $\\{1,2,3,4,5,...,r,...\\}$
- $r$ represents the general term
If **positive integers which are multiples of 5** are considered $\\{5,10,15,20,25,...,r,...\\}$
Then the **harmonic series** = the infinite sum of reciprocals of positive integers:
$$ \\text{i.e. } 1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{3} + ... + \\dfrac{1}{r} + ...$$

<br />

###### **Sigma Notation**

**Sigma ($\\Sigma$) notation** = compact form of representing series
- Upper bound: The **largest value** that $r$ can take.
- Lower bound: The **smallest value** that $r$ can take

$$ \\sum_{r = 1}^{10} r = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10$$

Read this as "The sum of $r$, from $r = 1$ to $r = 10$."
