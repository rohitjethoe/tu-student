###### **Opening investigations**

A **sequence** = list of numbers written in a defined order, ascending, descending or following a specific rule.

Each number making up a sequence is called a **term**:

- A sequence is also called **progression**.
- Sequences may be **finite** or **infinite**

    <ul class="circle">
        <li>The sequence $7, 5, 3, 1, -1, -3$ is a <span class="gray">finite squence</span> with six terms</li>
        <li>The sequence $7, 5, 3, 1, -1, -3, ...$ is an <span class="gray">infinite sequence</span></li>
    </ul>

<br />

<span class="gray">A sequence is also written in terms of</span> **the general term** as $ \\{u_r\\} $, where $ r $ can take values $1, 2, 3, ...$
- If the sequence is finite, then $r$ will <span class="gray">terminate at some point</span>.
- $ \\{ u_r \\} $ represents the sequence
- $ u_r $ represents the $r$th term.

The sequence $ \\{ u_r \\} = [3r - 1] $, where $ r \\in \\Z^+ $ represents the infinite sequence $ 2, 5, 8, 11, ... $

<br />

A **series** = all of the terms in a sequence added together

- can be either *finite* or *infinite*.

<br />

The set of positive integers $ \\Z^+ $ can be written as:

$$ \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., r, ... \\} $$

- $ r $ represents the general term.

If positive integers which are multiplers of 5 are considered:

$$ \\{5, 10, 15, 20, ...5r, ...\\} $$

- In this case the general term is $ 5r $

<br />

The **harmonic series** is the infinite sum of the reciprocals of positive integers

$$ 1 + \\dfrac{1}{2} + \\dfrac{1}{3} + ... + \\dfrac{1}{r} + ... $$

Series can be represented <span class="gray">in compact form using</span> **sigma ($ \\Sigma $) notation**.

- Sigma uses the general term in terms of $r$, which often represents a positive integer.

$$ \\sum_{r = 1}^{10} r$$

Read this as <span class="gray">"The sum of $r$, from $r = 1$ to $r = 10$"</span>

Let's say we want the sum of positive multiples of 5 less than 100:

$$ \\sum_{r = 1}^{20} 5r = 5 + 10 + 15 + ... + 100 $$

Or sometimes our sum expands into individual terms:

$$ \\sum^{4}_{r=0} (2r+1) = (2 \\cdot 0 + 1) + ... + (2 \\cdot 4 + 1)  $$
