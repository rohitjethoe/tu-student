###### **Opening Investigations**

A **sequence** is a list of numbers written in a defined orderâ€”ascending, descending, or following a specific rule.

Each number making up a sequence is called a **term**:

- A sequence is also called a **progression**.
- Sequences may be **finite** or **infinite**.

    - The sequence $7, 5, 3, 1, -1, -3$ is a <span class="gray">finite sequence</span> with six terms.
    - The sequence $7, 5, 3, 1, -1, -3, \dots$ is an <span class="gray">infinite sequence</span>.

<br />

<span class="gray">A sequence is also written in terms of</span> **the general term** as $ \{u_r\} $, where $ r $ can take values $1, 2, 3, \dots$

- If the sequence is finite, then $r$ will <span class="gray">terminate at some point</span>.
- $ \{ u_r \} $ represents the sequence.
- $ u_r $ represents the $r$th term.

The sequence 

$$ \{ u_r \} = \{3r - 1\} \text{, where } r \in \Z^{+} $$

represents the infinite sequence $ 2, 5, 8, 11, \dots$

<br />

A **series** is the sum of all the terms in a sequence.

- A series can be either *finite* or *infinite*.

<br />

The set of positive integers $ \Z^+ $ can be written as:

$$ \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots, r, \dots \} $$

- $ r $ represents the general term.

If positive integers that are multiples of 5 are considered:

$$ \{5, 10, 15, 20, \dots, 5r, \dots\} $$

- In this case, the general term is $ 5r $.

<br />

The **harmonic series** is the infinite sum of the reciprocals of positive integers:

$$ 1 + \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{3} + \dots + \dfrac{1}{r} + \dots $$

Series can be represented <span class="gray">in compact form using</span> **sigma ($ \Sigma $) notation**.

- Sigma notation uses the general term in terms of $r$, which often represents a positive integer.

$$ \sum_{r = 1}^{10} r $$

Read this as <span class="gray">"The sum of $r$, from $r = 1$ to $r = 10$"</span>.

Let's say we want the sum of positive multiples of 5 less than 100:

$$ \sum_{r = 1}^{20} 5r = 5 + 10 + 15 + \dots + 100 $$

Or sometimes our sum expands into individual terms:

$$ \sum_{r=0}^{4} (2r+1) = (2 \cdot 0 + 1) + \dots + (2 \cdot 4 + 1) $$
