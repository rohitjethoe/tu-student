Mathematics uses functions to describe relationships between quantities and *model reality*. 

A **function** is a rule that associates each object in an input set with exactly one object in an output set. Functions can be thought of as machines: they take an input and produce a specific output. 

For example, a database program that returns only the first movie of an actor defines a function. 

In calculus, functions are restricted to real numbers, where each input produces exactly one output. 

For example, the "square function" takes a number like 3 and outputs 9, with both the *domain* and *codomain* being the set of real numbers \$\\R\$.

In summary, a function is a machine that establishes a relationship between two sets, with the condition that each input produces exactly one output.

How do we describe a function? Well first, we'll only consider functions that send numbers to numbers.

A natural question: given a function, how to describe what it does to it's possible inputs?

Functions can be describes in four main ways:

1. __Formula__: Provides a concise, unversal rule for all inputs. The square function can be expressed as \$f(x) = x^2\$, where \$x\$ is the input, and \$x^2\$ is the output; or as:

$$ f : x â†’ x^2 $$

is read as 'f colon x to x squared'.

Formulas are powerful but may not always be practical or possible for real-world data.

2. __Table__: Summarizes relationships between specific inputs and outputs, such as lap times in a race or population data over years.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Time</th>
            <th>World Population</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1000 AD</td>
            <td>310,000,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1500 AD</td>
            <td>460,000,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1800 AD</td>
            <td>1,000,000,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1900 AD</td>
            <td>1,650,000,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2000 AD</td>
            <td>6,000,000,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2025 AD</td>
            <td>8,100,000,000</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Tables have a drawback that they only represent finite points, as with our function \$x^2\$, it's impractical.

3. __Graph__: Offers visual overview of a functions behavior, showing trends like <u>increasing</u>, <u>decreasing</u>, or <u>extrema</u>. 

Graphs make properties easy to interpret; __but__ lack <u>precision</u> and cannot represent the full domain

4. __Words__: Describe the function's behavior in <u>plain language</u>.

e.g. the _floor function_ maps a number \$x\$ to the largest integer less than or equalto \$x\$. Words can clarify what tabels, graphs or formulas might _obscure_.

It's useful and important to be able to switch between these four ways to describe a function, especially for standard functions.
