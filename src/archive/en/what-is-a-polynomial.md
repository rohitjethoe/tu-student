**Polynomials and Calculators**  
Modern calculators rely on addition and multiplication as their foundational operations. Using these, a large class of functions can be constructedâ€”**polynomial functions**. These are formed by combining a variable \$ x \$ with constants using addition and multiplication.

**Definition of a Polynomial**  
A polynomial function is defined by an expression called a polynomial. For example:  
$$p(x) = 2x^5 - 12x + 3 + \\frac{1}{2}x$$ 

By expanding and simplifying, this expression can be written in its **standard form**, which arranges terms as:  

$$a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$$
Here:

- \$ n \$ is the degree (highest power of \$ x \$ in standard form).
- \$ a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots \$ are coefficients $real numbers, possibly negative or fractional$.  

**Steps to Simplify a Polynomial**  
1. Expand products by distributing terms.  
2. Combine terms with the same power of \$ x \$.  
3. Order terms from highest to lowest power of \$ x \$.  

**Importance of the Degree**  
The degree of a polynomial affects its behavior:  
- As \$ x \\to \\infty \$ or \$ x \\to -\\infty \$, the polynomial approximates the behavior of its highest-degree term \$ a_n x^n \$.  
- For example, \$ p$x$ = 2x^3 + 8x^2 - 13x \$ behaves like \$ 2x^3 \$ for large \$ |x| \$.  

**Calculators and Non-Polynomial Functions**  
While calculators can efficiently evaluate polynomials due to their reliance on addition and multiplication, they approximate functions like \$ \\sin(x) \$, \$ \\cos(x) \$, or \$ \\ln(x) \$ using polynomials (via methods like Taylor series). This demonstrates the versatility of polynomials in approximating other mathematical functions.

The video concludes with a teaser for understanding how polynomial degree relates to function behavior and the approximation of more complex functions.
