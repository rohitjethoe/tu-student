#### Definition of Rational Functions:
- A **rational function** is the ratio $ \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} $, where $ P(x) $ and $ Q(x) $ are polynomials, and $ Q(x) \\neq 0 $.
- Rational functions can represent complex relationships that involve addition, multiplication, and division of variables and constants.
- Polynomials are special cases of rational functions where $ Q(x) = 1 $.

#### Properties and Domain:
- The function is undefined where $ Q(x) = 0 $. These points are excluded from the domain.
- The zeros of $ P(x) $ (where $ P(x) = 0 $) are the **zeros of the rational function**, provided $ Q(x) \\neq 0 $ at those points.

#### Graph Characteristics:
1. **Asymptotes**:
   - **Vertical asymptotes** occur at the zeros of $ Q(x) $ (where the denominator is 0).
   - **Horizontal asymptotes** occur if the degree of $ P(x) $ is less than or equal to the degree of $ Q(x) $:
     - For large $ x $, divide $ P(x) $ and $ Q(x) $ by the highest power of $ x $ in $ Q(x) $ to find the asymptote.
   - **Oblique asymptotes** may occur when the degree of $ P(x) $ is one more than the degree of $ Q(x) $.

2. **Zeros**:
   - Zeros of the rational function are the zeros of $ P(x) $, provided $ Q(x) \\neq 0 $ at those points.

3. **Behavior at Asymptotes**:
   - Near vertical asymptotes, the function tends to $ \\pm \\infty $, depending on the sign of the fraction.
   - Horizontal or oblique asymptotes describe the end behavior of the function as $ x \\to \\infty $ or $ x \\to -\\infty $.

4. **Graphing Notes**:
   - Simplify expressions where possible.
   - For points excluded from the domain (e.g., removable discontinuities), use open circles on the graph.

#### Operations on Rational Functions:
- To add or subtract rational functions, find a common denominator.
- Simplify results into a single fraction when possible.

#### Example Calculations:
1. Average speed calculation:
   $$ \\text{Average speed} = \\frac{23}{\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{20}{v}} = \\frac{23v}{\\frac{1}{10}v + 20} $$
   This results in a rational function with a quotient of linear polynomials.

2. Adding rational functions:
   $$ \\frac{1}{x-2} + \\frac{1}{x^2+2} = \\frac{x^2 + x}{(x-2)(x^2+2)} $$

#### Summary:
- **Rational functions** are quotients of two polynomials.
- Their **domain** excludes points where the denominator is zero.
- Graphs feature **asymptotes**, **zeros**, and domain-specific behaviors.
- **Operations** include adding fractions by finding a common denominator.
