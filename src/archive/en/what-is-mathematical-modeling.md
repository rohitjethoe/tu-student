Mathematics, particularly Calculus, is used to solve real-world problems by using *mathematical modeling.* 

This involves *analyzing* a problem. breaking it into smaller questions, and describing relationships between variables through functions.

For example, optimizing a solar car’s performance requires *modeling* power input and losses due to factors like air and roll friction.

Solving such models often involves equations to find optimal solutions, like maximizing speed under given conditions.

Power input of **the Nuna 7:**

$$P_{in}=\\eta_{eff}∗A∗P_{sun}(\\alpha_{sun})∗cos(\\alpha_{sun})$$

Power loss of **the Nuna 7:**

$$P_{loss}=P_{roll}+P_{air}+P_{elec}$$

Applications span fields like engineering, medicine, and economics, addressing questions such as minimizing energy use, maximizing profit, or designing efficient systems. 

Core topics include the properties and applications of functions like:

*polynomials functions*

$$f(x) = x^3$$

*exponential functions*

$$f(x) = e^x$$

*trigonometric functions*
