Mathematics, particularly Calculus, is used to solve real-world problems by using mathematical modeling. 

"Design a solar car that can drive the long distance as fast as possible, using only the Sun as power source".

<br />


**1. Real-world problem:**

This involves analyzing a problem. breaking it into smaller questions, and describing relationships between variables through functions. In terms of energy:

- We want to maximize power input

- And minimize power loss

We want to try and reformulate it in terms of a mathematical model.

<br />


**2. Mathematical model:**

A mathematical model describes the relation between different parameters that are of influence in this real-world problem.

- Power input of **the Nuna 7:**

$$P_{in}=\\eta_{eff}∗A∗P_{sun}(\\alpha_{sun})∗cos(\\alpha_{sun})$$

- Power loss of **the Nuna 7:**

$$P_{loss}=P_{roll}+P_{air}+P_{elec}$$

<br />


**3. Mathematical conclusions:**

After mathematically modeling our functions we can start making calcutations. Solving such models often involves equations to find optimal solutions, like maximizing speed under given conditions.

<br />


**4. Real-world predictions:**

If mathematical conclusions are made, we interpret the results to make real-world predictions, and ultimately, you will have to test your predictions.

Applications of *mathematical modeling* span fields like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering" target="_blank">engineering</a>, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine" target="_blank">medicine</a>, and <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics" target="_blank">economics</a>, addressing questions such as minimizing energy use, maximizing profit, or designing efficient systems. 

Over the few weeks core topics will be covered, including the properties and applications of functions like:

- *polynomials functions*: \$f(x) = x^3\$

- *exponential functions*: \$f(x) = e^x\$

- *trigonometric functions*: \$f(x) = sin(x)\$
